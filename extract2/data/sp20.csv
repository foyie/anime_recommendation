Raised together as children, they came to know of the ""Wizard King""—a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom—and promised that they would compete against each other for the position of the next Wizard King. However, as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident.

Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a ""Black Clover"" giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty.
